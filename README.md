# Out-Of-Africa-Hypothesis-Testing

The Out of Africa hypothesis gained rapid acceptance in the late 1980s, with pioneering analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which revealed very low mean nucleotide variation between the mtDNA of individuals from diverse populations (Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson 1987). This suggested that the species was young, since one interpretation of low levels of variation is that there was a genetic bottleneck in the recent past, such as would occur at speciation, and little time since then for subsequent variation to accrue. Moreover, the fact that more variation occurred in African groups suggested Africa as the source.

As modern humans dispersed from Africa, probably in small populations, they experienced a dramatic bottleneck. As a consequence, African populations today harbor more genetic diversity than any other population in the world, and the genetic diversity found in non-Africans represents only a subset of that found in Africa


The NGS data has been taken from the 1000 Genomes project of SNPs in the European and the African population. This involves checking which haplotype has the reference allele and which has the alternative allele and plotting of the allele frequency spectrum using bar plots for both the populations. Lastly, it requires the computation the bootstrap 95% confidence interval for average pairwise diversity statistics for European, African and between European and African population.
